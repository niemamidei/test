The *Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold* is a mass organization for the defense of the Republic against the extremists who threaten it. Some would call it a paramilitary, although currently it is hardly any sort of military. It is officially associated with the pro-democratic parties -the SPD, Center, and [+ ddp_name +], but by far the largest component is with the SPD.
